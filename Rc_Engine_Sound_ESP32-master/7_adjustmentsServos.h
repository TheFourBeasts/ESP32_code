/* SERVO OUTPUT SETTINGS ************************************************************************************************

 * The CH1 - CH6 headers are used as outputs in BUS communication mode (SBUS, IBUS, PPM)
 * This allows to use as super compact "bus-only" receiver
 * Set the endpoints here in microseconds (equal to -45 to 45Â° servo angle)
 * !! WARNING: Don't connect a receiver to the "CH1 - CH6" headers, if BUS communication is selected. Ihis will short them out!!
